The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset is a 37 category pet dataset with roughly 200 images for each class created by the Visual Geometry Group at Oxford.


 The images have a large variations in scale, pose and lighting.

 All images have an associated ground truth annotation of breed, head ROI, and pixel level trimap segmentation.


The following annotations are available for every image in the dataset:

  (a) species and breed name;

  (b) a tight bounding box (ROI) around the head of the animal; and

  (c) a pixel level foreground-background segmentation (Trimap).
